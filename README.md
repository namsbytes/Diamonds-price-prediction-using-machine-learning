Diamonds are valuable and rare gemstones that play a significant role in various industries, including jewelry and investment. Predicting diamond prices accurately is crucial for stakeholders in the diamond market to make informed decisions. This study explores the application of machine learning techniques for diamond price prediction, leveraging a dataset comprising diverse features such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and depth. The goal is to develop a robust predictive model capable of estimating diamond prices with high precision.

The methodology involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the selection of appropriate machine learning algorithms. Various regression models, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, are implemented and compared to identify the most effective approach. Additionally, ensemble methods and hyperparameter tuning are employed to enhance model performance.

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the machine learning models in capturing the complex relationships between diamond characteristics and prices. The selected model achieves a high level of accuracy in predicting diamond prices, providing valuable insights for market participants. The implications of this research extend to diamond industry stakeholders, investors, and consumers, facilitating more informed decision-making processes in the dynamic and competitive diamond market.
